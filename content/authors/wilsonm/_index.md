As my wife knows, I am not a talker and am often not the most expressive person. This blog is an attempt to put words to my thoughts. I am at best an inattentive user of social networks. Another goal for this blog, is to tie together my online presence.

I often work on a variety of personal projects. I am currently taking several classes and working on some different certifications. I hope to document my journey.

### My Mantra

I will learn from the past, plan for the future and live in the present. I will face the storm of fear and I will let it pass over and through me. When the fear is gone, I will remain. I will be a lighthouse for both family and friends. I will choose the path of honesty and integrity. I will “do it now, do it right, do the hard part first”. I will accept that both success and failure as part of life and I will learn from both. I will seek to learn, for learning is the basis for growth, and growing is the key to living. I will seek first to understand, for understanding is key to finding value, and value is the basis for respect, decisions, and action. I will help my children and others to grow beyond their current boundaries. I will build a reputation of being dedicated to every goal I choose to pursue while having successes in both my personal and professional life.
