# Looking at my Struggles

Here lately, everything has become a struggle. Some of it has to do with COVID-19 and smoe has to do with my health in general. I am having a hard time controlling my appetite. i am hungry all the time. although I am doing a pretty good job of being heart healthy. i am not being calorie free.

Additionally, some of my work is suffering. i am just not making the progress I would l III ke on my dissertation. it is hard to workon it in the evenings after working all day. 

I need to spend some time this weekend deciding how and what I need to change.
