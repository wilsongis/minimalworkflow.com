## Weeks 2 and 3 with a Bullet Journal

So far, my experience with a BuJu has been positive. I am no longer maintaining OmniFocus. My entire ToDo and project material is now in my notes. This is a major change for me and i feel like i am ontrack. 

In week 3, i was off of work. although i did not use the journal constantly, i still kept it at the ready. i did make mistake of looking online for for spread ideas. my previous suspicions that i have no artistic ability were proved. my journal looks like a preschooler went to town. with that said i am still feeling good. 

i have been pleasantly surprised with the bullet journal. i will continue to document my adventures.
