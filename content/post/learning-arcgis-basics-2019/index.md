After a long, long, slog, I am finally releasing an updated to my ArcGIS book. The new book covers several new topics including Data Management and Geocoding. I have also included a section on finding a GIS Job. 

The purpose of this book is to introduce the reader to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and ArcGIS Desktop 10.x by ESRI.

Over the years, I have worked with various GIS lessons, tutorials and how-to books, websites, and other resources. This book is a compilation of all the various "best practices" that I have learned. My goal is to help those new to GIS and ArcGIS to develop a solid foundation upon which to build.

Topics Covered:

Chapter 1 - Introduction
Chapter 2 - Data Management
Chapter 3 - The ArcGIS Suite
Chapter 4 - The GIS Workspace
Chapter 5 - Project Management and GIS
Chapter 6 - Displaying Spatial Data
Chapter 7 - Selecting Features
Chapter 8 - Symbolizing Data
Chapter 9 - Making A Layout
Chapter 10 - Mid-Term Exercise 1
Chapter 11 - Using Attribute Data
Chapter 12 - Creating and Editing Data
Chapter 13 - Geocoding and GPS Data
Chapter 14 - Coordinate system and Projection
Chapter 15 - Geoprocessing
Chapter 16 - Final Exercise
Chapter 17 - Tips for a GIS Interview
