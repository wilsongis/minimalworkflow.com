It was a good week back to work. My biggest issue was that i was extremely tired. my guess is that the medications have me feeling this way. The doctor's office wants me ti give it another week to see how my body adjusts. i am hoping that my energy levels increase. With that said, i can survive either way. 

Another adjustment has been that of my new normal. With every twinge from my chest, i tense up. I need to come to grips with the heart attack and make my peace. I dint want these worries to keep causing me issues. 

Diet wise, i am doing well. i am watching my cholesterol, fat, and sodium intake. i think i have made a significant reduction. it will be interesting to see what my next set of blood work looks like. 

I hope to keep making positive progress this week. i am going to try to add meditation to the mix.
