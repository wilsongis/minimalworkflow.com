As part of my day job, I am the Director of the APSU GIS Center. For the past couple of months we have been working in collaboration with Google to develop the 
[InnovaTN Games](http://innovatn.org). The games will introduce kids to drone flight, engineering, and programming. The event will be in April on the APSU campus. 

As we finalize the details, I will post more info.
