This week marked a year since my heart attack. I have done well curbing my cholesterol and bad fat intake but i have struggled with my weight. The meds really mess with me. Besides a huge appetite, i am tired all the time. Although these are drawbacks, I do like being alive so there is that. 

One of the changes that i need to make is exercise. I am trying to get back in the habit. as with all things good for me, it is hard. Covid has also increased the friction. I really need to try meditation. It is a habit that I can't get to stick.

Although where I am at is not perfect, i am happy to be here.
