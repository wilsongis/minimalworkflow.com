# Is This Who We Now Are?

I saw this headline this week ["Court upholds ruling that children held at border must have adequate food, bedding, sanitation"](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-15/children-border-sanitary-conditions-flores-agreement-9th-circuit). Intellectually I knew thing were bad in the detention facilities. The fact that a judge has to order the government to provide clean water, food, and sanitary conditions is reprehensible. I have no faith that this order is being followed.

I am ashamed that this is where we are at as a country.
