[Sidewinder X1 PS3 Camera Mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4667692)

My design of a PS3 Eye camera mount for the Sidewinder X1. With the duct I am using, I wanted the camera mount to be even with the nozzle. It is remixed from the following:

[Artillery Sidewinder X1 Sony PS3 Eye Camera Mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3911504)

I did print with support.
