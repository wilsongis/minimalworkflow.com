# My Freshman Year in High School

For grades K-12 I attended Catholic School. I don't have any horror stories about nuns and rulers. Overall, I believe that I got a good education. My biggest regret is my freshman year in High School. 

 Between the summer of 8th grade and 9th grade i drifted apart from most of my friends. Additionally, I was never a social butterfly and i was (and am) a huge geek. With 9th grade, I was going to a new school and was without a real group of friends. Being awkward and without friends made me a target for bullying. 
 
 Most of that year, I spent keeping a low profile and not drawing attention to myself. A "bright spot" for that year, was working for a priest in one of the school offices. Father M was a cool guy and easy to work for. An upper class guy and 2 girls woked with me. i can't even remember their names. Since none of my tormentors were there, i felt safe. I kept my mouth closed and tried to fit in.
 
 Towards the end of my freshman year, one of the girls told us, her co-workers, that Father Mike had "touched" her. The other students and I called her a liar. That was probably the last time I saw her. 
 
  
  This week I saw the headline, [The Catholic Church Shakes as Sex Victims Act Opens Window of Justice](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-catholic-church-shakes-as-sex-victims-act-opens-window-of-justice). I can't help but think of that girl we dismissed. Instead of listening, and helping her, I did the opposite. I hope that she eventually got justice and healing. [Father Mike was a molester](https://adamhorowitzlaw.com/clergy-abuse/fr-michael-swierzy-archdiocese-of-philadelphia/). 
  
 I don't like that I was bullied but my biggest regret and what I hate most about my Freshman year was the treatment of that poor girl. She needed help and I did not give it. For that I was always be sorry.
