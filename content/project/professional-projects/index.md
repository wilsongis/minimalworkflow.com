My Professional Projects

Over the years, I have had the blessings to work on a variety of projects. I have worked on:

- GIS
- Programming
- Data Science
- Environmental
- Web Development

Outside of GIS, I have self-taught for the other topics. It has been an interesting ride. The projects listed here are some of the projects I have worked on that others might find of interest.
