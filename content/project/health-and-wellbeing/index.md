## A Project to Build a Better Me

Over the past several years, my age has started to catch up to me. My metabolism has really slowed down, my stress verging on out of control, and I have aches and pains.

As has always been the case, I tend to get the spare tire. Unfortunately, this tends to be the [worst type of weight][1]. Added to the weight issues, I am also struggling with stress. To combat my issues, I am taking the following step:

- Eating Healthier
- Reduce my portion size
- Drink Water
- Meditation
- Add more physical activity
